# ffbsdl
CLI FFB editor written in C with SDL2

# Dependencies

+ SDL2

Installation on Linux is simple, `sudo apt install libsdl2` for Debian-based systems and something very similar for others, please check with your distro.

Installation on Windows is a bit more complicated, but I recommend using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and following their installation instructions up to step 7, after which you should run `pacman -S mingw-w64-x84_64-SDL2` before continuing with their instructions.

# Building

`make`

# Running

`./ffbsdl`

On-screen instructions should hopefully be clear enough to follow without a manual.
